# Personal Portfolio Website

## Introduction

This repository contains my personal portfolio website. I created this website to showcase my skills, projects, and basic information about myself as a web development learner.

## How I Created This Portfolio Website (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Planning the Website
First, I decided what sections I wanted in my portfolio. I planned to include:
- About Me
- Skills
- Projects
- Contact Information

### Step 2: Creating the Project Folder
I created a new folder on my laptop and named it "portfolio".  
Inside the folder, I created the following files:
- index.html
- style.css
- images folder (for pictures)

### Step 3: Writing the HTML Structure
In the `index.html` file, I wrote the basic structure of the website using HTML.  
I added:
- Headings
- Paragraphs
- Sections
- Navigation
- Links

This file builds the main structure of the website.

### Step 4: Styling with CSS
In the `style.css` file, I added styles to improve the design.  
I changed:
- Colors
- Fonts
- Layout
- Spacing
- Alignment

This made the website look clean and attractive.

### Step 5: Adding Basic Interactivity
I used simple JavaScript (if needed) to add small interactive features to the website.

### Step 6: Testing the Website
I opened the `index.html` file in my browser to check if everything worked correctly.  
I fixed any mistakes and improved the design.

### Step 7: Uploading to GitHub
After completing the website:
1. I created a repository on GitHub.
2. I uploaded all project files.
3. I enabled GitHub Pages.
4. My portfolio went live online.
